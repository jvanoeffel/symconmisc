# BasisLib

The BasisLib Repository contains the following modules:

- __Dimmer__ ([Documentation](Dimmer/readme.md))  
	Dimmer module for controlling the lights. Short press will turn the lights on/off longh press dims the lights.

- __HVC Ophaaldatums__ ([Documentation](HVC/readme.md))  
	Shows the dates when the bins are emptied and gives a push notification the day before.

- __functions.ips.php__ 
This file is not needed in the symcon module, but for development it is nice to have all the functions in place so PHP Intelephense doesn't get mad.
